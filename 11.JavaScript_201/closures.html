		<h2>Closures</h2>
		<p>
			From
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures"
				>MDN</a
			>:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
			with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
			other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In
			JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at
			function creation time.
			<br />
			[...]
			<br />
			A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment
			within which that function was declared.
		</blockquote>

		<p>For example:</p>
		<code>
			<pre>
function init() {
	var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
	function displayName() {
		// displayName() is the inner function, that forms a closure
		console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
	}
	displayName();
}
init();
</pre
			>
		</code>
		<blockquote>
			Closures are useful because they let you associate data (the lexical
			environment) with a function that operates on that data. This has obvious
			parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow you to
			associate data (the object's properties) with one or more methods.
			<br />
			<br />
			Consequently, you can use a closure anywhere that you might normally use
			an object with only a single method.
